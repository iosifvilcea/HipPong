Original Pong but way cooler.

TODO:

    Adjust so that chosen buttons actually work. 

Known Issues:
    -Size is off.
    -Paddles intersect.
    -Bottom Paddle/ball is out of sync.
    -Menu is not the right size.
    -Round Speed Up gets stuck. Fix it so when the wall is enabled, the limit
    is changed to the frame.
