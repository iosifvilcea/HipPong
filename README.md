HipPong
=======

Original Pong but way cooler.

TODO:
    Quit/MainMenu
    Resume/Pause for "ESC"
    Implement Computers
    Swap controls back to default

    Add BlackHole
    Add Point System
    Adjust so that chosen buttons actually work. 

Known Issues:
    -Paddles intersect.
    -Bottom Paddle/ball is out of sync.
    -Menu is not the right size. Needs to be 700x700
    -Round Speed Up gets stuck. Fix it so when the wall is enabled, the limit
    is changed to the frame.
