Original Pong but way cooler.

TODO:

    Resume/Pause for "ESC"
    Implement Computers
    Swap controls back to default

    Add BlackHole
    Add Point System

Known Issues:
    -Paddles intersect.
    -Bottom Paddle/ball is out of sync.
    -Menu is not the right size. Needs to be 700x700
    -Can't distinguish between similar keys.
      ex: up/down/left/right is the same as 8, 2, 4, 6 on num pad.
