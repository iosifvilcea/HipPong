HipPong
=======

Original Pong but way cooler.

TODO:
    make the main menu call work
    Implement Computers
    Swap controls back to default
    check for proper max points entry and switch to doc listener

    Add BlackHole
    Add Point System

Known Issues:
    -Paddles intersect.
    -Bottom Paddle/ball is out of sync.
    -Can't distinguish between similar keys.
      ex: up/down/left/right is the same as 8, 2, 4, 6 on num pad.
