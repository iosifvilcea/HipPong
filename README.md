Original Pong but way cooler.

TODO:

    Fix 2nd Player Paddle
    Add BlackHole

    Fixed Screen Size
    Get Fixed Size, base paddle position off of it.
    Implement Walls/Computers
   
NOTES:
    Ball doesn't detect 2nd Player Paddle in the right location.
    Will be fixed once we have a fixed size for the screen.
    1200x900 is way too big.
