HipPong
=======

Original Pong but way cooler.

TODO:
    make the main menu call work
    Implement Computers
    Swap controls back to default
    check for proper max points entry and switch to doc listener

    Add BlackHole
    Add Point System
    Adjust so that chosen buttons actually work. 

Known Issues:
    -Paddles intersect.
    -Bottom Paddle/ball is out of sync.
    -Round Speed Up gets stuck. Fix it so when the wall is enabled, the limit
    is changed to the frame.
