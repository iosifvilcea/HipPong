HipPong
=======

Original Pong but way cooler.

TODO:
    Swap controls back to default

    Add BlackHole.
    Make Shit Pretty.

Known Issues:
    -Paddles intersect.
    -Computer paddles aren't smooth and aim to get ball at edges
	(logic needs improvement)
    -First round is null, so when game starts, no points are awarded.
