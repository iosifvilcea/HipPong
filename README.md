HipPong
=======

Original Pong but way cooler.

TODO:
    make the main menu call work
    Implement Computers
    Swap controls back to default
    check for proper max points entry and switch to doc listener

    Add BlackHole

Known Issues:
    -Paddles intersect.
    -On win, gameOver goes HAM. Should pause everything. 
    -First round is null, so when game starts, no points are awarded.
