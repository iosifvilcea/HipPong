#HipPong
###By Daniel DeLeon & Iosif Vilcea

    HipPong is a remake of the classic Pong game, but with some cool twists.
    HP allows you to play among 4 friends or a combination of friends and computers.
    
    Score is based on turns, with the last person that touches the pong
    receiving the point. This gives it a strategic feel as you are not
    competing against the ball, but your friends.

    HP also contains some special events to make it a bit more challenging.
    In the middle, you have a Blackhole which if the ball passes through, it
    spits it back out with a random direction.
    As the game goes on, the ball also changes speeds, so be prepared!
