HipPong
=======

Original Pong but way cooler.

TODO:
    Swap controls back to default

Known Issues:
    -Paddles intersect.
    -If ball direction changes to x=0 y=w/e, or x=w/e y=0, ball gets stuck
    going back and forth between 2 paddles.
    -If both walls and both computers selected, game gets stuck.
    -Ball speed needs to be faster. Sometimes it gets way too slow.
    -on resume, if x out, program doesnt resume, it's still paused.
